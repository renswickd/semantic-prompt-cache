# RAG + Semantic Cache System

This project is designed to enhance a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline with a custom-built Semantic Cache system. The primary goal is to reduce redundant LLM (Large Language Model) calls, improve system responsiveness, and optimize cost for real-time and large-scale AI applications.

## ðŸš€ Purpose

In traditional RAG pipelines, every user query is processed through document retrieval and LLM generationâ€”even if a semantically similar query was already answered. This approach increases latency and inflates API usage costs.

This system introduces a semantic caching layer that intercepts incoming queries and compares themâ€”based on meaning, not just keywordsâ€”against previously answered queries. If a sufficiently similar query is found, the cached response is reused, bypassing the need for another LLM call.

## ðŸ”§ Use Cases

- **Chatbots with memory efficiency**  
  Minimize repeated LLM calls for frequently asked or rephrased questions.

- **Enterprise knowledge assistants**  
  Provide consistent and faster answers to similar user queries across departments.

- **High-throughput RAG pipelines**  
  Scale to thousands of queries per day while maintaining performance and reducing cost.

- **Latency-sensitive applications**  
  Reduce end-user wait time by short-circuiting the full RAG flow when a cached response is available.

## ðŸ”— Project Direction

This is currently a work-in-progress implementation. The project will be structured as a modular, functional codebase, designed to be easily integrated into larger LLM pipelines without requiring object-oriented complexity.

Stay tuned for functional modules covering semantic caching, vector index management, retrieval integration, and LLM orchestration.
